That file for components what i need to buy for my robotic manipulator.

**The prices of the components are approximate**

I create few rules for components what i need.
    **1. The components must be cheap**
    **2. The components must be a strong enough for system**
    **3. I can buy any of the components at a regular hardware store.**
