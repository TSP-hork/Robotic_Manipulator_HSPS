# 2025-08-13: The Project is Public!

## Milestone
Today, I've made the repository public and started this development log. This marks the official start of the public phase of the project.

## Current Status
The majority of the conceptual CAD work for the core 3-axis mechanics is complete (around the 90% mark). I've been so focused on design iterations and preparing for the first printing tests that I haven't committed the CAD files to the repository yet.

## Next Steps
My immediate goal is to clean up the models and push the complete set of F3D/STEP files to the /cad directory by this Saturday (August 16th).

## Comment
