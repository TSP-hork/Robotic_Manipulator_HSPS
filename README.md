# Robotic_Manipulator_HSPS

This repository is dedicated to the development of a High-Performance, Open-Source Robotic Manipulator based on a Hot-Swappable Part System (HSPS).

## Hot... what?

Yes, "Hot-Swappable" sounds strange for a robotic arm. Controlling a robot like this usually requires deep programming skills and a complex system understanding, making most designs rigid and hard to modify. My goal is to make it easier. And no, this is not a toy for grabbing cubes.

## What does "not a toy" mean?

A toy can grab something. A toy can rotate. This robot is designed to be a true industrial tool. It's designed to be precise and powerful enough to mill its own parts from aluminum, to weld, or to perform any task you can imagine.

The core idea is simple: This project provides a blueprint for anyone with common tools (like a 3D printer) and dedication to build an instrument capable of creating almost anything.

## How "good" is this cheap thing?

You might be thinking: "Okay, so you're making a cheap little arm and believe it can compete with a true, big, metal one? That's nonsense." And you are half right. This robot can't mill hardened steel or titanium. But does it need to?

What we all really need are strong, precise parts. We can't 3D-print metal, but this robot is designed to be precise enough to **mill aluminum**. This means you can use the first plastic robot to create the parts for its much stronger, metal successor. Sounds more realistic now, doesn't it?

But what about the "brains"? I've got you covered there too. This robot is being designed to run its control loop at **50 kHz**. This means it can react to a command in **20 microseconds** - the time from your signal to a change in the motor's current. And yes, it will work with almost any motor you want.

## Nice to meet you

I bet this sounds interesting. I just want to say hello, and I'm glad to see you here. This project started on May 27, 2025, and my goal is to build the first working prototype by next summer.

Maybe I'll make it, maybe I won't, but we'll find that out together. For now, you can find me here every Saturday. Let's get started!
